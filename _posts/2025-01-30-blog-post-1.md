In this post, I’ll walk you through my workflow for creating realistic 3D models for games. We’ll cover everything from concept art to final implementation in Unity.

## Step 1: Concept Art
Start with a clear concept to guide your modeling process.

## Step 2: High-Poly Modeling
Use Blender to create a high-poly version of your model.

## Step 3: Texturing
Export your model to Substance Painter for PBR texturing.

## Step 4: Optimization
Reduce polycount and bake normal maps for real-time rendering.
