## Introduction
In this post, I’ll walk you through my workflow for creating realistic 3D models for games. We’ll cover everything from concept art to final implementation in Unity.

## Step 1: Concept Art
Start with a clear concept to guide your modeling process.

## Step 2: High-Poly Modeling
Use Blender to create a high-poly version of your model.

```python
# Example Python code for automation
import bpy
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add()
